                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Technology was something that mesmerized me since I was a child, specifically videogames. I would spend hours playing Pokémon, 
                    Super Mario Bros., Oregon Trail, and various other computer, console, and handheld games. This captured my attention because 
                    of their immersive environments, beautiful art, and overall fun. As time went on, other games would come and go, and my reason 
                    to play was always the same. However, once I started high school, I started to wonder how these games worked and were made. I 
                    started taking introductory computer classes where I fell in love with programming ever since.

                    My original intent to major in Software Engineering was to one day become a game developer, but I no longer limit myself just to 
                    this anymore. I’ve come to enjoy programming, design, testing, and development throughout my college career and see it as both a 
                    joy and challenge for myself. I’m always reading up on different topics in game and technology. And when I’m not doing that, you’ll 
                    probably find me having fun with friends, taking pictures, hanging out with family, or most likely, playing videogames.
